## About The Project

In this project we created a recipe tracking/meal planning [application](https://alexthompson207.github.io/whats-cookin/). Users have the ability search/filter a list of recipes and favorite recipes. They also have a dedicated pantry with special features for analyzing the items they have in stock. Each recipe can be inspected by the user and relevant information is provided to them such as an ingredient list, instruction set, and cost to make the recipe. 

The focus of this project was to implement ES6 classes and use an Object Oriented Programming structure. We implemented a robust testing suite using test driven development and utilized the `Mocha Framework` and `Chai Assertion Library`. In addition to planning the structure of our data we designed a user interface that is fully responsive and displays information in a clear way on multiple screens.

#### Built With:

- [![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-black?style=flat-square&logo=javascript)](https://www.javascript.com/) with `ES6` implementations

- ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-black?style=flat-square&logo=html5&logoColor=white)

- ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-black?style=flat-square&logo=css3)

  

## Set-up Instructions

1. Fork this [Github repository](https://github.com/alexthompson207/whats-cookin) and clone it down to your local machine using the `git clone` command in your Terminal.
2. Move into that directory with `cd whats-cookin` in your Terminal.
3. To see the code itself locally, run `<name of text editor> .`
4. To see how the tests are run:
  - Run `npm install`
  - Rum `npm test`
5. To see the application locally, run `open index.html` 



## Learning Goals
- Deeper understanding of array prototype methods, and combining that with DOM manipulation.
- Practice using array iterator methods on double-datasets to manipulate data.
- A better understanding of OOP and how to plan/structure classes.
- More practice with HTML and CSS, and creating a responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Using proper Event Delegation while providing a clean and easy to use user interface. 



## Challenges

1. Planning: intentionally planning an overall strategy before writing code. This included class structures and methods, and their respective tests, creating a wireframe for all the layouts, and implementing a detailed `gitHub` project board.
2. Working between multiple datasets where the only commonality to match them was an `id`. Then creating functions and methods that could be reused later in the projects progression. 




## Wins

1. We built the minimum viable product (MVP) where the user can view, filter, search, and favorite recipes without encountering any bugs.
2. The testing suite is specific with happy/sad path outcomes and 61 total `it` blocks.
3. Creating a user interface that is easy to use and displays information on multiple screens.

## Future Iterations

1. Allow a user to input their own pantry upon page load.
2. Implement a rating system for recipes, such as a 5 star rating system, or a way to leave a review.
3. Error handling when searching for recipes by ingredient or name. Implementing a more robust search so users can search by part of a recipe name.
